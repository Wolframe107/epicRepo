Differences between C# and other languages:
As when comparing every programming language there are of course a ton of small 
differences that can be found. Like for example the way you write in console. 
These changes however are the easiest to wrap your head around. One of the larger
differences I found was the way you have to declare the type of the variable
when creating the variable. Another one is the way you create lists. I like
this way of writing code as it makes everything logically fit together and
you get what it says on the tin. There are of course drawbacks, for example 
that there is a lot more "fluff" you need to write in order to get stuff working.
